# NodeJs Express Template App
This is a template where I can start a RestAPI App

# Getting started

## Running the App (For development purposes only)

* 1 - Clone the repo and open the terminal in the path where you clone the repo
* 2 - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
* 3 - Run `npm start` to start the application, this will fire up the nodemon dependency using the index.js file and the port 3000, you can change this in the package.json file
